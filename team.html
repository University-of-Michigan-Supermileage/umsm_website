					<h1>Subsystem Breakdowns</h1>
					<p>Starting Fall 2024, we have moved away from sub teams towards sub systems. Moving from sub teams
						to subsystems is a big transition, but the focus is to shift the team to working on a project
						basis which is more collaborative across a subsystem which can feature many different
						components. We have also switched from weekly subteam meetings to workblocks, so different parts
						of the team will always be working together! Feel free to join more than one, many members do
						work across multiple systems, and projects tend to overlap.</p>

				<h2>Body</h2>
				<p>The Body Subsystem encompasses the design, manufacturing, and optimization of the outer shells of our
					vehicles to achieve maximum efficiency. This involves constructing the vehicle's shell by
					manufacturing molds and performing layups, which can be done with various composites or other
					materials like carbon fiber. Using advanced Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software alongside
					computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools, the team iterates the carbon fiber body design to minimize
					the coefficient of drag, thereby enhancing vehicle efficiency. Key focus areas within this subsystem
					include the aerodynamic layout, surface geometry, and material composition of the vehicle shell.</p>
				<b>Leads:</b> Chief Aerodynamics Engineer
				<hr />
				<h2>Mechanical Systems</h2>
				<p>The Mechanical Systems Subsystem is responsible for the design, manufacturing, assembly, and testing
					of all mechanical components of our vehicles. This includes a primary focus on steering, brakes,
					wheels, chassis, firewall, axles, and mounts for both the powertrain and aerodynamics. Utilizing
					advanced design and validation tools such as Siemens NX, the team ensures maximum efficiency and
					structural integrity. The subsystem collaborates closely with all other subsystems to ensure
					optimized design, mounting, and structural support across all vehicle aspects.</p>
				<b>Leads:</b> Chief Vehicle Dynamics Engineer, Chief Structures Engineer
				<hr />
				<h2>Electrical Systems</h2>
				<p>The Electrical Systems Subsystem covers the comprehensive design and implementation of all electrical
					components within our vehicles. This includes designing modular printed circuit boards and
					architecting the motor control code, which together operate our electric powertrain vehicles. The
					team is actively developing a new battery and battery management system to maximize efficiency.
					Additionally, the subsystem applies embedded systems fundamentals and various sensors to collect and
					transmit vehicle data for performance analytics, diagnostics, and signal processing using tools.</p>
				<b>Leads:</b> Chief Power Electronics Engineer, Chief Telemetry Engineer
				<hr />
				<h2>Powertrain</h2>
				<p>The Powertrain Subsystem is tasked with selecting and optimizing the most efficient motors for both
					battery electric and internal combustion vehicles. Through simulations and dynamometer testing, the
					team ensures that each vehicle's motor—whether electric or internal combustion—is controlled
					effectively and operates at peak efficiency. Specifically, for the internal combustion vehicle, the
					subsystem focuses on meticulously modifying the engine's characteristics through engine mapping both
					physically and via software to achieve optimal fuel efficiency while ensuring the necessary power
					output for race completion.</p>
				<b>Leads:</b> Chief Powertrain Engineer
				<hr />
				<h2>Systems</h2>
				<p>The Systems Subsystem integrates various simulation, analysis, and optimization efforts to enhance
					overall vehicle performance. This includes calculating road load equations, finding the optimal
					racing line, generating theoretical efficiency plots for both powertrains, and modeling the track.
					These simulations guide race strategy and inform areas for improvement. The subsystem is also
					responsible for writing requirements based on First Design Principles, developing validation tests
					for each subsystem, and employing systems engineering principles to ensure proper integration.
					Additionally, the Systems Subsystem manages team resources, including sponsorship, public relations,
					finance, and project management, overseen by the Executive Board, which consists of the Project
					Manager and Chief Engineer.</p>
