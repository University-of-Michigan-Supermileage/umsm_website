						<p>The University of Michigan Supermileage Team is a student-led project team engineering
							competitive, single-occupancy, ultra-efficient vehicles. We have students across all
							disciplines, including Mechanical, Electrical, Computer, Environmental, and Aerospace
							engineering, Engineering Physics, Robotics, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Art &
							Design, Business, Finance and more!</p>
						<p>This year our team is taking on two engineering challenges! Firstly, we're continuing
							development of our urban-concept internal combustion vehicle, Maple. Secondly, we are
							designing our upcoming car an urban concept electric vehicle, Cedar. If you are looking for
							hands on manufacturing or design experience, stop by!

					<h2>Our History</h2>
				</header>
				<div class="content-container">
					<div class="text-content">
						<p>In 2010, a small group of University of Michigan students formed a team with the goal of
							designing the most fuel-efficient internal combustion concept car in North America. These
							original eleven students attempted to answer one question: what would it take to create a
							vehicle capable of achieving over 3,000 miles per gallon? When our team came into being, the
							North American record was 3,169 mpg, and we knew that our challenge was to beat that record
							and to achieve competitive success in fuel economy competitions such as SAE Supermileage
							(our namesake competition) and the Shell Eco-Marathon. Currently, the University of Michigan
							Supermileage Team only competes in the Shell Eco-Marathon but competed with two cars in
							2024! With our entry to the prototype battery electric class, we achieved a 121.3 Mi/kWh or
							a 4100 MPGe</p>
